Simple Vocab Plus (plugin for Omeka)
====================================

This [Omeka] 2.1+ plugin allows administrators to create, edit, and update 
controlled vocabularies either defined in Omeka or in the cloud. 

[Simple Vocab Plus] is an improved fork of the official [Simple Vocab].
The user interface is optimized too.
